## Introduction
This repository consists of the backend of [this](https://nicole9925.github.io/facial-analysis-frontend/) web application. It is fully ready to be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
and is expected to be used alongside the [front-end](https://github.com/nicole9925/facial-analysis-frontend/tree/master). Because it uses over 800MB of RAM,
deploying this application will require a paid Heroku membership. For more information on its functions, please visit our [blog](https://michael4706.github.io/XAI_Website/).
